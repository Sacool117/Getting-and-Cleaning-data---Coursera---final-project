#Readme document - Coursera project

##Basics
This repo was created in course of the Coursera spezialisation "Getting and Cleaning data" and its final project.
For dealing with these data you have to:
-Download the raw data in your working dir.
-Download the source code "run_analysis.R
-Execute the source code

##Code tasks
The source code was written by the following the Coursera project tasks:

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the   following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for    each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data      set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each        subject."

##Data description
The x values in the dataset were measured with an accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung mobile phone.
The y value indicates the coresponding activity type of each subject.

##New tidy dataset
The final tidy dataset is descripted in the "CodeBook.md" file
